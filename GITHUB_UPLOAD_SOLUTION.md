# GitHub Upload Solution

## Problem Analysis

Your repository has several GitHub upload issues:

1. **Multiple failed upload scripts** (46+ versions indicate persistent problems)
2. **You're on a feature branch** (`prf-auto-20250617-191804`) instead of `main`
3. **Token embedded in remote URL** causing authentication issues
4. **28 commits ahead** of remote branch
5. **Complex scripts** with too many dependencies and failure points

## Simple Solution

I've created two simple, reliable scripts to fix these issues:

### 1. `git_cleanup.sh` - Clean up your repository

This script will:
- Clean the remote URL (remove embedded tokens)
- Switch you to the `main` branch
- Optionally merge your current branch changes
- Stash and restore uncommitted changes
- Delete old branches if desired

**Usage:**
```bash
./git_cleanup.sh
```

### 2. `github_upload_simple.sh` - Reliable GitHub uploads

This script will:
- Load your GitHub token from `.env` file
- Clean and authenticate the remote URL
- Add, commit, and push changes
- Clean up the remote URL afterward (for security)
- Provide clear status messages

**Usage:**
```bash
# With default commit message
./github_upload_simple.sh

# With custom commit message
./github_upload_simple.sh "Your commit message here"
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clean up your repository
```bash
./git_cleanup.sh
```

Follow the prompts to:
- Merge your current branch into main
- Delete the old branch
- Apply any stashed changes

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
```bash
./github_upload_simple.sh "Fixed GitHub upload issues"
```

### Step 3: Verify success
The script will show you:
- Repository URL
- Current branch
- Upload status

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Simple and focused** - Does one thing well
2. **Secure** - Removes tokens from remote URL after use
3. **Interactive** - Asks for confirmation on important actions
4. **Error handling** - Fails fast with clear error messages
5. **No complex dependencies** - Uses standard git commands

## Your Current Situation

- **Current branch:** `prf-auto-20250617-191804`
- **Commits ahead:** 28 commits
- **Token:** Already configured in `.env` file
- **Remote:** `https://github.com/swipswaps/postcard-lister.git`

## Next Steps

1. Run `./git_cleanup.sh` to get to a clean state
2. Run `./github_upload_simple.sh` to upload your changes
3. Delete the old complex upload scripts if desired

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Permission denied:** Make sure scripts are executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x git_cleanup.sh github_upload_simple.sh
   ```

2. **Token issues:** Check your `.env` file contains:
   ```
   GH_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
   ```

3. **Remote issues:** The cleanup script will fix remote URL problems

4. **Merge conflicts:** If merging branches fails, resolve conflicts manually:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Edit conflicted files
   git add .
   git commit
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Reliable:** Simple scripts are less likely to fail
- **Maintainable:** Easy to understand and modify
- **Secure:** Tokens are handled safely
- **User-friendly:** Clear prompts and status messages
- **Recoverable:** Easy to undo or retry operations
